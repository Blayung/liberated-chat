# Liberated Chat

## What is this?
It is probably the simplest minecraft spigot plugin that disables chat reporting.  
  
**This plugin currently supports all minecraft versions from 1.19 to 1.20.6.**

## How to compile? (assuming you're on linux, probably only technical people interested)
0. Make sure you have jdk 21 and git installed. If not, check these links out: [https://www.oracle.com/pl/java/technologies/downloads](https://www.oracle.com/pl/java/technologies/downloads), [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads). You can also try to install these programs with your distro's package manager.
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Blayung/liberated-chat.git; cd liberated-chat`
2. Compile the plugin: `./gradlew build`
3. Now the plugin jar file should be here: `./build/liberated-chat-1.2.3.jar`
